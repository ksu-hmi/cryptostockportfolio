# CRYPTO Roadmap

## Find example Python program for getting crypto data through an API. DONE
 - I have found an excellent Python template from https://github.com/huwwp/cryptop which uses an API from cryptocompare.com
 - Added the top ten bitcoin prices that can be used to see the trend for data analysis.

## Build a crypto currency portfolio App with Python
 - Create functions to add, remove, and update crypto holdings DONE
 - The roadmap will be to build a python App that goes and looks up current pricees of different cryptocurrencies and then output the results on the screen.

### We will do it in a couple of difference ways:
 - (1) From the command line by just using straightup python code DONE
 - (2) Build a GUI Desktop App

# STOCK Roadmap

## Use Yfinance API to get stock data
 - Will potentially use this as a python template https://github.com/JordanDotT/StockInfo 
 - YFinance API will need 3 mandatory arguments in this order:
### (1)Tickers 
### (2)Start date + End date or Period 
### (3)Interval
